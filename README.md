Presented here are the scripts used for data analyses for the data chapters of my thesis. 
Provided below is a summary of the analyses conducted, along with a list of conda environments and relevant programs used.


## Chapter 2: Characterising immune gene diversity in translocated wild tchūriwat’ (*Thinornis novaeseelandiae*)
In this chapter, I charaterised toll-like receptor (TLR) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in captive and wild tchūriwat. I develop and test methods to impute low-coverage whole genome sequencing data when a large reference data set is not available.

## Chapter 3: Investigating associations between immune gene diversity and immune response in tchūriwat’ (*Thinornis novaeseelandiae*)
