First README file


## 02 Aug 2022
Tara iti allignments failed: no space, but could be because running too many scripts at a time (have space)

Tuturuautu no dup doesn't exist. Markdup instead?
Using Markdup:cat
-
 Still struggling with no index found. Next step, re index from fixing index script
 - could try index then run mosdepth straight away? Is is sorted ok?
- Rerun python at bottom wih correct file location
CR02 needs to have stats rerun from 3_alignment_tidyup_tuturuatu_2.sh

If qualimap (.graphmap) doesn't look right for nodup files, this could be because I killed it part way through the first one (CR01).
In nodup stats, I think CR01.stats etc is just copies of dup.stats made earlier (woops). Accidentally deleted CR02.stats from this folder (but think this is a duplicated of dup.stats)

NEED TO NODUP STATS CR01


Necessary programs:
- samtools
- bamtools
- etc...
- qualimap
- mosdepth
